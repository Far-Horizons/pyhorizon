# pyhorizon
A custom python program that integrates multiple tools into one easy to use recon tool. This is my first cybersec tool, and is still in early stages of development.

## About me
I am a first-year computer science student, and I enjoy doing bug bounty. I am still a beginner in this field, but have found a few vulnerabilities (granted, very boring ones).

## About the project
I started this project for 2 reasons: I want to improve my coding skills, and I want to automate some of the repetetive tasks of bug bounty.

For now my plan is to create this tool to be as modular as I can make it, using an object-oriented approach. This way the tool will be easier to modify, and it's parts will be easier to re-use in future tools.

## Dependencies
Pyhorizon is built to use other tools through Python subprocesses, mainly due to me not having the knowledge to build tools similar to those used and because I want to avoid any potential issues from re-using the code written by other people.

Therefore it is required you have the following tools installed and preferably up to date:
- Subfinder (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
- Findomain (https://github.com/Findomain/Findomain)
- DNSX (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx)
- ffuf (https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)

## Disclaimer
Don't expect super high-quality code, or innovative new methodologies from this project (at least for now) as I am not an expert coder or bug hunter by any means. I am doing this to learn!
Feedback about my code is however quite welcome, granted that the feedback is constructive. Feel free to tell me my code is shit, but if you do please also tell me WHY it is shit and how I can improve it!

## Collaboration
If you wish to join me in developing this (or just want to give feedback), feel free to send me a dm on discord (._Lars)! Please do state that you came from here in the message, as I will likely assume it is just another scam message if you just say "hi" ;).

## Public usage
Feel free to use my tool for you own purposes! Do keep the following in mind though:

This tool is built for educational, ethical, legal, and responsible use only. Do not use this tool on any target that you do not have explicit and written permission from. Do not use this tool for any illegal, unethical, or irresponsible goals.

You are welcome to create your own tools based on my tool, but please do provide proper credit when using my code, and I also appreciate it if you let me know that you're using it!

## Statement on generative AI usage
Since one of the main reasons this project exists is because I want to learn from it I will not, or barely, be using generative AI. The code in this project will all be hand-written, with the exception of some autocompletes from github copilot in VSCode (this will generally not be more than finishing a line I was typing). Outside of this all the code will be manually written, as otherwise it would defeat the point of this project.
