# pyhorizon
A custom python program that integrates multiple tools into one easy to use recon tool. This is my first cybersec tool, and is still in early stages of development.

## About me
I am a first-year computer science student, and I enjoy doing bug bounty. I am still a beginner in this field, but have found a few vulnerabilities (granted, very boring ones).

## About the project
I started this project for 2 reasons: I want to improve my coding skills, and I want to automate some of the repetetive tasks of bug bounty.

## Disclaimer
Don't expect super high-quality code, or innovative new methodologies from this project (at least for now) as I am not an expert coder or bug hunter by any means. I am doing this to learn!
Feedback about my code is however quite welcome, granted that the feedback is constructive. Feel free to tell me my code is shit, but if you do please also tell me WHY it is shit and how I can improve it!

## Collaberation
If you wish to join me in developing this (or just want to give feedback), feel free to send me a dm on discord (._Lars)! Please do state that you came from here in the message, as I will likely assume it is just another scam message if you just say "hi" ;).
