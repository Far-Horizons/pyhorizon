# pyhorizon roadmap
This is the roadmap for the pyhorizon project. While I say roadmap it is more like a checklist of features I want to add and changes I want to make, but whatever.

## Features to add:
- subdomain permutation, to find more subdomains
- verbosity modifier
- rate limiting
- crawler integration
- technology footprinting

## To-do changes to existing features:
- add dependency / tool checks.
- catch and log errors

## Completed:
- change interactive input into argparse setup. this will make it easier to use and allows me to pass flags.
